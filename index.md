# Hi, I'm Jerry Fang!
Welcome to my ICS4U portfolio. I’ll use this site to post my work and reflections.

## Highlights
- 🔧 Project 1: Dreams of You – This is a dating simulator involving minigames and earning love points to get an anime girl to love you!
- 🧠 Concept I learned: Learned how to implement ingame concepts such as minimap, character movement, and trackers for score.
- 📝 Blog/Reflection: [Reflection #1](./posts/first_reflection.md) (To be made)

## About me
I learnt python, java, and java processing. 

My hobbies include working out, piano, running.

In the future I hope to be in a Stem branched career, such as health sciences or mechanical engineering.

I hope to learn Computer Science obviously, but more broadly, I hope to learn more computational and competition type problems you see on math contests to develop a wider range of knowledge and critical thinking.

I am very interesting.
