# Project Reflection
What I learned throughout programming this project:

- Topic(s): Problem Solving and Procrastination
- What I struggled with: This project was big, this took a lot of time and time that I mostly wasted through procrastination.
- What Iâ€™m proud of: The amount of work I was able to complete in a short period of time due to my fast typing speed and quick brute force problem solving skills.
- Next steps: Though brute force and fast typing works on the lower levels, building a stronger programming foundation will make sure my coding journey and problem solving abilities have no limits, and are efficient as possible.
